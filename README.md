## Description
This is a web developer quiz built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is a timed quiz that prompts the user to select answers to various questions
concerning web development. Wrong answers will subtract time from the timer while right answers will add points to ones final score.
The quiz will notify the user of the wrong or right answer, as well as sending a message based on total points accumulated. One is
 also capable of submitting their initials (or name), in order to be stored locally and rendered on the highscore list. I have built this
quiz code from scratch using functions/click events/Javascript that dynamically changes content on a click.
